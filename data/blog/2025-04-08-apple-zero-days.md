   - Impact: Safari WebKit engine
   - Risk: Could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code
   - Affected: All devices running Safari
   - Severity: Critical
   - Status: Exploited in sophisticated attacks

2. **CVE-2025-24201: WebKit Engine Vulnerability**
   - Impact: WebKit engine
   - Risk: Could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code
   - Affected: iOS, macOS, Safari, and Vision Pro
   - Severity: Critical
   - Status: Exploited in sophisticated attacks

3. **CVE-2025-24085: Accessibility Framework Vulnerability**
   - Impact: Accessibility framework
   - Risk: Could allow physical attackers to disable USB Restricted Mode on locked devices
   - Affected: iOS, macOS
   - Severity: Critical
   - Status: Exploited in sophisticated attacks

### What You Need to Do

Apple has released emergency updates for all affected platforms. Users should:

1. Update to the latest iOS 18.3.1 and iPadOS 18.3.1
