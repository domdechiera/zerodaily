Apple has issued an urgent security advisory concerning three critical zero-day vulnerabilities that have been actively exploited in sophisticated attacks against specific targeted individuals.[^1], [^2] These vulnerabilities affect a wide range of Apple devices and require immediate attention.[^1]

## The Actively Exploited Vulnerabilities

1. **CVE-2025-24200: Safari WebKit Vulnerability**
   - Impact: Safari WebKit engine[^3]
   - Risk: Could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code
   - Affected: All devices running Safari[^1]
   - Severity: Critical[^3]
   - Status: Exploited in sophisticated attacks[^2]

2. **CVE-2025-24201: WebKit Engine Vulnerability**
   - Impact: WebKit engine[^4]
   - Risk: Could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code
   - Affected: iOS, macOS, Safari, and Vision Pro[^2]
   - Severity: Critical[^4]
   - Status: Exploited in sophisticated attacks[^2]

3. **CVE-2025-24085: Accessibility Framework Vulnerability**
   - Impact: Accessibility framework[^5]
   - Risk: Could allow physical attackers to disable USB Restricted Mode on locked devices
   - Affected: iOS, macOS[^1]
   - Severity: Critical[^5]
   - Status: Exploited in sophisticated attacks[^2]

## What You Need to Do

Apple has released emergency updates for all affected platforms.[^1] Users should:

1. Update to the latest iOS 18.3.1 and iPadOS 18.3.1
2. Update to the latest macOS version
3. Update Safari to the latest version
4. Update Vision Pro to the latest version

These vulnerabilities are being actively exploited in sophisticated attacks targeting specific individuals.[^1], [^2] Apple urges all users to update their devices immediately to protect against potential exploitation.[^1]

## Timeline

- March 13, 2025: Vulnerabilities added to CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.[^2]
- March 2025: Apple releases emergency updates.[^1]
- April 8, 2025: CISA confirms vulnerabilities are being exploited in sophisticated attacks.[^2]

## Impact on Different Apple Devices

1. **iPhones/iPads**
   - All models running iOS/iPadOS 16.4 and earlier
   - Update to iOS/iPadOS 18.3.1

   - Security improvements: Safari, WebKit, Accessibility framework

3. **Apple Watches**
   - All models running watchOS 9.3 and earlier
   - Update to watchOS 9.4
   - Security improvements: CoreGraphics

## Why These Zero-Days Are Dangerous

These vulnerabilities are particularly concerning because:

- They were actively exploited in sophisticated attacks
- They allow for arbitrary code execution
- They bypass existing security controls

## Final Thoughts

The discovery and patching of these zero-day vulnerabilities highlight the importance of keeping Apple devices updated with the latest security patches. The fact that they were being actively exploited in sophisticated attacks underscores the need for immediate action.[^1], [^2]
