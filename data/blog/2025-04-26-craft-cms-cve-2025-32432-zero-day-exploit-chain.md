## Key Takeaways

- Attackers are actively exploiting a zero-day exploit chain (CVE-2025-32432) in Craft CMS to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) and exfiltrate data from compromised servers.[^1]
- The exploit targets the image transformation endpoint, abusing asset ID logic to inject and execute malicious code.
- The campaign was first observed in February 2025 and continues to impact unpatched Craft CMS installations as of late April 2025.[^1]
- Official patches have been released for Craft CMS versions 3.9.15, 4.14.15, and 5.6.17. Immediate upgrade is strongly recommended.[^1]
- The attack chain demonstrates the ongoing risk of chained vulnerabilities and the importance of timely patching and monitoring.

## What Happened?

In early 2025, security researchers and incident responders observed a coordinated campaign exploiting a newly discovered zero-day vulnerability chain in Craft CMS. The attackers leveraged CVE-2025-32432 to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) and exfiltrate sensitive data from targeted servers.[^1]

The exploit chain abuses the image transformation feature of Craft CMS. By sending crafted POST requests to the `/index.php?p=admin/actions/assets/generate-transform` endpoint and enumerating valid asset IDs, attackers could manipulate the server into interpreting malicious payloads. This allowed arbitrary PHP code execution, leading to full server compromise and data theft.[^1]

## Technical Details

- **Vulnerability:** CVE-2025-32432 (Craft CMS Asset Image Transformation RCE)
- **Attack Vector:** Unauthenticated POST requests to the image transformation endpoint, incrementing asset IDs to find valid targets
- **Impact:** Remote code execution, file upload, data exfiltration, persistent access
- **Affected Versions:** Craft CMS 4.x and 5.x (prior to 4.14.15 and 5.6.17)
- **Patch Released:** April 2025

### Exploit Chain Steps

1. **Asset ID Enumeration:** Attackers use automated scripts to enumerate asset IDs by sending repeated POST requests with incremented IDs.
2. **Payload Injection:** Upon finding a valid asset, a malicious payload is sent to the transformation endpoint, which is interpreted by the server.
3. **Code Execution:** The server executes the injected PHP code, granting attackers full control.
4. **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers attempt to download and execute tools (e.g., filemanager.php) for persistent access and data theft.

## Timeline

- **Feb 2025:** In-the-wild exploitation observed during forensic investigations.[^1]
- **Mar–Apr 2025:** Vulnerability analysis, vendor notification, CVE assignment, and patch development.[^1]
- **Apr 2025:** Official patches released; public advisories and technical blogs published.[^1]

## Detection & Mitigation

- **Upgrade Immediately:** Patch to Craft CMS 3.9.15, 4.14.15, 5.6.17 or later.
- **Audit Logs:** Review server and application logs for suspicious POST requests to the image transformation endpoint.
- **Monitor Assets:** Check for unauthorized file uploads or modifications, especially in asset directories.
- **Network Controls:** Restrict access to admin endpoints and monitor for unusual outbound connections.

## Final Thoughts

This incident highlights the critical importance of rapid patching and continuous monitoring for organizations using popular CMS platforms. Chained vulnerabilities remain a favored technique for attackers, and timely response is essential to prevent compromise and data loss. Organizations should review their asset management and endpoint security controls to mitigate future risks.
