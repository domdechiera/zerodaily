On April 24, 2025, Microsoft Defender XDR mistakenly classified legitimate Adobe Acrobat Cloud URLs as malicious, prompting users to submit their flagged files to ANY.RUN’s online sandbox—where free-tier uploads default to public sharing. [^1]

## Incident Overview

Microsoft Defender XDR, part of the Microsoft 365 Defender suite, uses machine learning to detect threats across cloud and endpoint environments.

During a routine scan, the platform misidentified URLs under _acrobat[.]adobe[.]com/*_ as malicious indicators. Concerned users then turned to the free tier of ANY.RUN, a popular malware analysis sandbox, to verify the alerts.

Because ANY.RUN’s free plan defaults to public file sharing, more than 1,700 Adobe Acrobat documents containing proprietary and confidential data from hundreds of organizations became publicly accessible. [^2]

## How the Leak Occurred

- **False Positive Trigger:** Defender XDR flagged benign Adobe Acrobat Cloud links, labeling them as potential malicious activity. [^1]
- **Free-Tier Sandbox Default:** Many users, seeking quick verification, uploaded their documents to ANY.RUN’s free sandbox, unaware that uploads would be indexed publicly. [^3]
- **Public Exposure:** The sandbox’s default settings allowed any visitor to view and download the uploaded files, leading to a large-scale unintentional data breach.

## Impact and Response

The exposed documents included internal reports, technical specifications, executive presentations, and other sensitive corporate content—potentially enabling industrial espionage, privacy violations, or regulatory non-compliance.

Within hours of discovery, ANY.RUN changed the privacy settings for affected analyses to private mode and issued warnings: “Always use a commercial license for work-related tasks to ensure privacy and compliance.” [^4] Microsoft has yet to publish an official advisory but is investigating the root cause of the misclassification.

## Lessons for Security Teams

- **Balanced Detection Tuning:** Security platforms must calibrate machine learning models to minimize false positives without sacrificing threat coverage.
- **Sandboxing Policies:** Organizations should enforce strict guidelines on the use of public analysis tools, reserving them for non-sensitive workflows or licensed private tiers.
- **User Education:** End users need clear instructions on safe handling of alerts and the privacy implications of external tools.
- **Incident Response:** Integrate threat detection with approved internal sandbox environments and ensure rapid communication channels with vendors for false positive resolution.

## Final Thoughts

The Microsoft Defender XDR false positive incident underscores that even trusted security tools can inadvertently cause massive data exposure if automated alerts drive user behavior into unsecured channels.

As cloud-based security and analysis services proliferate, maintaining robust configuration, user training, and vendor collaboration is critical to preventing similar leaks.
