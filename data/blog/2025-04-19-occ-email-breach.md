The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has disclosed a significant cybersecurity breach that exposed over 150,000 emails from 100 OCC officials, including highly sensitive information on federally regulated banks.[^2][^1] The intrusion, which began in May 2023, went undetected until early 2025 and has resulted in major institutional and industry repercussions.[^2]

### Timeline and Scope

- **May 2023:** Attackers compromise an administrative account with broad access.[^2]
- **May 2023–Feb 2025:** Over 150,000 emails and attachments accessed by threat actors, many containing sensitive bank data.[^2]
- **Feb 2025:** Microsoft detects unusual network behavior and notifies OCC.[^2]
- **April 2025:** OCC publicly discloses breach; major banks begin limiting information sharing with OCC.[^3]

### Attack Vector and Detection

The breach was enabled by the compromise of an overprivileged administrative account lacking proper segmentation and monitoring.[^2] Notably, the OCC failed to detect the intrusion; Microsoft identified the breach in February 2025 through abnormal network activity.[^2]

### Impact and Industry Response

- Emails and attachments viewed by attackers included confidential information about the financial health of regulated banks.[^2]
- OCC’s CIO warned that the exposure is “likely to result in demonstrable harm to public confidence.”[^1]
- JPMorgan, BNY Mellon, and other major banks have limited data sharing with the OCC until security can be assured.[^3]

### OCC Organizational Response

- The OCC elevated its Information Technology and Security senior deputy comptroller to the executive team.[^1]
- Merged the Midsize and Community Bank Supervision and Large Bank Supervision departments into a new Bank Supervision and Examination division.[^1]

### Severity and Recommendations

- **Severity:** High. The breach’s long dwell time, scope, and sensitivity of data present ongoing risks to the financial sector.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Regulators: Enforce least-privilege access, invest in real-time monitoring, and conduct regular third-party security audits.
  - Financial Institutions: Limit sensitive data sharing with regulators until security is assured; monitor for targeted phishing or downstream attacks.
