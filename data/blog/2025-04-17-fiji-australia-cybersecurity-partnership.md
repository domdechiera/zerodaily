Fiji and Australia this week reaffirmed their cybersecurity partnership under the Vuvale Framework, celebrating one year since the signing of their cyber collaboration Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).

### Partnership Milestones

At a ceremony in Suva, Fiji’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Communications, Manoa Kamikamica, highlighted the partnership’s achievements:

- Australian support for penetration testing of Fijian digital infrastructure
- Establishment of Fiji’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), which will serve as a central node in the country’s cyber defense network
- Close cooperation with telecom providers and critical service operators

### Strategic Initiatives and Regional Impact

Kamikamica announced that Fiji’s National Cybersecurity Strategy will soon be released, drawing guidance from Australia’s 2023 Cybersecurity Strategy. The two countries are also collaborating regionally through the Lagatoi Declaration Action Plan, a blueprint for strengthening Pacific cyber resilience, with expected endorsement at upcoming Pacific ICT Ministers and Pacific Islands Forum meetings.

On the international stage, Fiji and Australia are working together in the UN Open-Ended Working Group to shape global cyber norms and laws. Fiji has also joined the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, further aligning its legal framework with international standards.

### Commitment to a Secure Digital Pacific

Both governments reiterated their commitment to building a secure and resilient digital future for the Pacific region, emphasizing the importance of strong partnerships, capacity building, and regional cooperation in the face of evolving cyber threats.

### Why It Matters

- Strengthens Fiji’s capacity to detect and respond to cyber threats through the new CERT.
- Sets a regional model for Pacific cyber resilience and cooperation.
- Facilitates knowledge transfer, training, and infrastructure upgrades with direct Australian support.
- Aligns Fiji’s legal and strategic frameworks with international standards (Budapest Convention, UN cyber norms).
