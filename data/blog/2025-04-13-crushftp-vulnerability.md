## What is CVE-2025-31161?

CVE-2025-31161 is a critical authentication bypass vulnerability that affects CrushFTP versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 through 11.3.0.[^2][^3] This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the file transfer system, potentially leading to complete system compromise.[^1]

### Impact and Risk

The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating critical severity.[^3] Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to:[^1]

1. Bypass authentication mechanisms
2. Gain unauthorized access to file transfer systems
3. Potentially execute arbitrary code
4. Access sensitive data
5. Use the system as a pivot point for further attacks

### Current Status

- **Exploitation Status**: Actively exploited in ransomware campaigns.[^1][^4]
- **Detection**: Added to CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog on April 7, 2025.[^4]
- **Mitigation**: Immediate patching required.[^2]

### Technical Details

The vulnerability exists in the way CrushFTP handles S3-style authentication headers.[^1]
Specifically:

1. The system incorrectly accepts the "crushadmin/" credential as valid without proper password verification.[^1]
2. Attackers can exploit this by:
   - Using a spoofed AWS header
   - Crafting a specific 44-character CrushAuth cookie value
   - Manipulating the c2f parameter

### What You Need to Do

1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Update to CrushFTP version 11.2.3 or 10.8.3 immediately
   - These versions contain the security fix

2. **Detection**:
   - Monitor for unauthorized access attempts
   - Check system logs for suspicious activity
   - Implement network monitoring for exploitation attempts

3. **Prevention**:
   - Apply the security update as soon as possible
   - Consider disabling S3 protocol if not needed
   - Implement additional authentication layers
   - Regularly audit system access logs
