## Preparation Phase

### Required Incident Response Team Roles

- Incident Commander
- Technical Lead
- Communications Lead
- Legal/Compliance Representative
- Executive Sponsor
- External Relations (if needed)

### Essential Tools and Resources

- Offline copies of the playbook
- Secure communication channels
- Forensic investigation tools
- System restoration resources
- Contact information for all stakeholders
- Relationship with law enforcement

## Detection and Analysis

### Initial Indicators of Compromise

- Encrypted files with unusual extensions
- Ransom notes on desktop or as text files
- Unusual system behavior or performance
- Unexpected network traffic
- Antivirus/EDR alerts
- User reports of inaccessible files

### Immediate Assessment Steps

1. **Confirm the Incident**: Verify ransomware presence through file samples and system behavior
2. **Identify Ransomware Variant**: Use samples to determine specific strain
3. **Assess Scope**: Determine affected systems, networks, and data
4. **Document Initial Findings**: Record all observations and evidence
5. **Estimate Business Impact**: Evaluate critical systems affected and operational impact

## Containment Strategies

### Immediate Containment Actions

- Isolate affected systems from the network
- Disable affected user accounts
- Block relevant IOCs at network boundaries
- Preserve forensic evidence before containment
- Take system memory dumps where possible
- Capture network traffic for analysis

### Decision Points

- Criteria for system isolation
- Thresholds for broader network segmentation
- Conditions for complete network shutdown (extreme cases)
- Authorization requirements for containment actions

## Eradication and Recovery

### Malware Removal Process

1. Identify persistence mechanisms
2. Remove malware from affected systems
3. Verify removal through scanning and monitoring
4. Document all removed components for future reference

### Recovery Strategy Options

- **Clean Rebuild**: Wipe and rebuild affected systems
- **Restoration from Backups**: Verify backup integrity before restoration
- **Partial Recovery**: Prioritize critical systems first
- **Data Reconstruction**: When backups are unavailable or compromised

### Ransom Payment Considerations

- Legal and regulatory implications
- No guarantee of recovery
- Encourages future attacks
- May fund criminal or terrorist organizations
- Alternative recovery options should be exhausted first
- If considered, involve law enforcement and legal counsel

## Post-Incident Activities

### Forensic Investigation

- Determine initial access vector
- Identify lateral movement techniques
- Document data exfiltration evidence
- Establish complete timeline of the attack
- Preserve evidence for potential legal proceedings

### Lessons Learned Process

1. Conduct formal post-incident review
2. Document gaps in detection and response
3. Update security controls based on findings
4. Enhance monitoring for similar attacks
5. Revise incident response procedures
6. Conduct additional training if needed

### Reporting Requirements

- Internal executive briefing
- Customer/partner notifications
- Regulatory reporting obligations
- Law enforcement reporting
- Insurance notification

## Communication Templates

### Internal Communication

- Initial incident notification
- Status update template
- Recovery progress reports
- Post-incident summary

### External Communication

- Customer notification
- Media statement (if required)
- Regulatory disclosure
- Law enforcement engagement
