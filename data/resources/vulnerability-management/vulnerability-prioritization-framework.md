## The Challenge of Vulnerability Prioritization

Organizations today face an overwhelming number of vulnerabilities across their technology stack. Security teams must make difficult decisions about which vulnerabilities to address first with limited resources. This guide provides a structured framework for making these critical decisions.

## Beyond CVSS: A Holistic Approach

While the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) provides a useful baseline, effective prioritization requires additional context:

1. **Technical Severity** (CVSS and beyond)
2. **Business Context** (asset value and criticality)
3. **Threat Intelligence** (active exploitation status)
4. **Remediation Complexity** (effort and potential disruption)

## The Prioritization Framework

### Step 1: Assess Technical Severity

Start with the CVSS base score, but consider these additional factors:

- Attack vector (remote vs. local)
- Privileges required
- User interaction needed
- Impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability

### Step 2: Evaluate Business Context

Not all assets have equal value. Consider:

- Data sensitivity stored/processed
- Operational importance
- Customer impact if compromised
- Regulatory requirements
- Interconnections with other systems

### Step 3: Incorporate Threat Intelligence

Vulnerabilities being actively exploited require urgent attention:

- Evidence of exploitation in the wild
- Availability of public exploit code
- Threat actor interest in similar vulnerabilities
- Relevance to your industry or organization

### Step 4: Consider Remediation Factors

Some vulnerabilities, despite high severity, may be challenging to address:

- Patch availability
- Testing requirements
- Potential for service disruption
- Resource requirements
- Temporary mitigations available

## Implementing the Framework

### Risk Scoring Formula

A simple formula to calculate priority:

```python
Priority Score = (Technical Severity × 0.4) + (Business Impact × 0.3) + 
                (Threat Intelligence × 0.2) + (Remediation Complexity × 0.1)
```

### Practical Implementation Steps

1. **Document Your Criteria**: Clearly define how each factor is scored
2. **Create Assessment Templates**: Standardize the evaluation process
3. **Automate Where Possible**: Use vulnerability management tools
4. **Review Regularly**: Adjust weightings based on effectiveness
5. **Communicate Clearly**: Ensure stakeholders understand prioritization decisions

## Measuring Success

Effective vulnerability management should result in:

- Reduced mean time to remediate critical vulnerabilities
- No successful exploitations of known vulnerabilities
- Improved efficiency in remediation efforts
- Better alignment between security and business objectives
