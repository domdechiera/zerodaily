## Introduction to Web Application Penetration Testing

Web application penetration testing is a systematic process of identifying and exploiting security vulnerabilities in web applications. This methodology provides a structured approach to ensure comprehensive coverage and consistent results.

## Pre-Engagement Activities

### Scoping and Planning

- Define clear test boundaries and objectives
- Establish testing timeframes and authorized activities
- Document emergency contacts and escalation procedures
- Obtain proper written authorization
- Clarify testing limitations and constraints

### Information Gathering

- Review available documentation
- Understand application architecture
- Identify key functionality and business logic
- Determine appropriate testing tools and techniques
- Create testing accounts if needed

## Reconnaissance Phase

### Passive Information Gathering

- Domain and subdomain enumeration
- Historical data analysis (Wayback Machine)
- Technology stack identification
- Public data source review (GitHub, Pastebin, etc.)
- Search engine discovery

### Active Information Gathering

- Network port scanning
- Service enumeration
- Web server fingerprinting
- Framework identification
- Directory and file enumeration
- Virtual host discovery

## Mapping the Application

### Functionality Enumeration

- Identify all application features
- Map user roles and permissions
- Document authentication mechanisms
- Catalog input fields and parameters
- Identify server-side technologies

### Content Discovery

- Directory brute forcing
- Analyze robots.txt and sitemap.xml
- Discover hidden endpoints
- Identify API endpoints
- Map client-side code (JavaScript)

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Authentication Testing

- Password policy analysis
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Multi-factor authentication review
- Session management testing
- Account lockout testing

### Authorization Testing

- Vertical privilege escalation
- Horizontal privilege escalation
- Insecure direct object references
- Missing function-level access control
- Authorization bypass techniques

### Input Validation Testing

- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- SQL injection
- Command injection
- XML external entity (XXE)
- Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
- File upload vulnerabilities
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

### Business Logic Testing

- Workflow bypass attempts
- Business rule testing
- Integrity check validation
- Time-based attack scenarios
- Feature abuse and misuse cases

## Exploitation Phase

### Vulnerability Validation

- Proof-of-concept development
- Exploitation depth determination
- Impact assessment
- Chaining vulnerabilities
- Privilege escalation attempts

### Post-Exploitation Activities

- Data access assessment
- Lateral movement possibilities
- Persistence evaluation
- Evidence collection
- Clean-up procedures

## Reporting

### Documentation Requirements

- Executive summary
- Technical findings with severity ratings
- Reproduction steps with screenshots
- Impact assessment
- Remediation recommendations
- Risk-based prioritization

### Severity Classification

- Critical: Direct system compromise
- High: Significant data exposure or functionality compromise
- Medium: Limited data exposure or security control bypass
- Low: Minor security issues with limited impact
- Informational: Best practice recommendations

## Tools and Resources

### Recommended Testing Tools

- Web Proxies: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP
- Scanners: Nikto, Nuclei
- Reconnaissance: Amass, Subfinder
- Exploitation: Metasploit, SQLmap
- Custom Scripts: Python, Ruby

### Testing Frameworks

- OWASP Web Security Testing Guide
- OWASP Application Security Verification Standard
- NIST SP 800-115
- PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)

## Additional Considerations

### Legal and Ethical Considerations

- Stay within authorized scope
- Protect sensitive data discovered during testing
- Avoid denial of service conditions
- Report critical findings immediately
- Maintain confidentiality of results

### Modern Application Challenges

- Single-page application testing techniques
- API security testing approaches
- Mobile application integration points
- Cloud-native application considerations
- Microservices architecture testing
